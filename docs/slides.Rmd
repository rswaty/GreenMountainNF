# Goals
- Present maps and summary charts of a subset of LANDFIRE datasets
- Link to processed spatial data, attribute tables and assets
- Provide basic interpretive information

# LANDFIRE

Federal partnership between the USDA Forest Service and US Department of Interior that "provides 20+ national geo-spatial layers (e.g. vegetation, fuel, disturbance, etc.), databases, and ecological models that are available to the public for the US and insular areas." (https://landfire.gov/)

# LANDFIRE #2

Some characteristics of the data:
- Updates data periodically
- Datasets are free and cover all lands for the United States including insular islands
- Developed for large-scale analysis, planning and assessments

This presentation is a sample of the datasets and analysis that can be conducted.  Slides will be focused on proclamation area (ownership bounary will be in black on maps), however maps and charts for ownership area will be linked to on "Resources" slide.

*The Nature Conservancy has a cooperative agreement to provide user support, science and to develop appropriate uses of LANDFIRE products.*
